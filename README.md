WAVESPIRALVOLUMETRIC
--------------------

Experimental Processing software for generating 3D-printable helical structures of varying properties.  In an experimental state, please read through the code to get an idea of how the helices (or 'spirals') are generated and the options available. 

Some example models generated by this software can be found here:
